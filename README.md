Sit up straight with your legs bent, feet flat on the floor.
Keeping your legs together, slowly lift them off the floor until they form a 45-degree angle to your torso. Engage your entire core, keep your back flat, and balance on your tailbone.
You can keep your knees bent (as pictured) or straighten them out for more of a challenge.
Reach your arms straight out in front of you, parallel to the floor. If you feel that you need some extra support, place your hands on the floor, underneath your hips. This is High Boat.

High intensity
Plank jacks 
Start in a low plank position supported on your forearms and the balls of your feet, your hips aligned between your knees and shoulders. With your core braced to support the effort spread your legs out similar to the motion in a jumping jack and bring them back in.
Allow your knees to bend slightly as your feet land to help absorb the impact. Immediately hop your feet back into the air, bringing your legs together. Continue this in-and-out hopping motion, just as if you were performing jumping jacks, for the duration of the exercise.

Lunch/dinner:

Peanut butter zucchini noodles: 				
Ingredients
2 Tablespoons sesame oil (you’ll need more for the peanut sauce below)*
2 teaspoons minced or chopped garlic
1 cup shredded carrots
1 cup thinly sliced cabbage (I use red)
1 large bell pepper, thinly sliced (I use red)
3 large zucchini, spiralized into noodles*
2 large chicken breasts, cooked & shredded (about 2–3 cups)*
Toppings: 1 Tablespoon sesame seeds, handful of cilantro, 1/2 cup peanuts, chopped green onion
Peanut Sauce
1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
1/3 cup honey
1/3 cup soy sauce (reduced sodium)
2 Tablespoons sesame oil*
2 Tablespoons rice vinegar*
2 teaspoons fresh ginger, minced
1–2 teaspoons Sriracha or any hot chile sauce	
Instructions			
Heat 2 Tablespoons of sesame oil and the garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the carrots, cabbage, and pepper slices. Cook for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are a little tender. (I usually begin the peanut sauce, step 2, during this time.) Once tender, add the zucchini noodles and shredded chicken to the skillet. Cook and stir for about 3 minutes until the zucchini is a little softer and chicken is warm. Turn off the stove and remove from heat. Set aside. (*If your skillet isn’t quite big enough, you can do this step in batches.)
Combine all of the peanut sauce ingredients in a small saucepan over low heat. Whisk constantly until the peanut butter has melted and everything is combined. I usually use 2 teaspoons of Sriracha, but use the amount of heat you like.
Once the sauce is heated through, pour over chicken/vegetables. Toss everything around until combined. Place on a serving dish (or not!) and top with sesame seeds, cilantro, peanuts, and green onion. Serve immediately.
